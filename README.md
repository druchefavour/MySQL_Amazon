# MySQL_Amazon
## Introduction
In this work, I will create an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The function of the app is as follows:

1. Take in orders from customers
2. Deplete stock from the store's inventory
3. Track product sales across departments
4. Provide a summary of the highest gross departments in the store
